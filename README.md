# Stock Forecasting and Portfolio Optimization using Machine Learning techniques and modern portfolio theory

### Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science
### Project 2 - 2024 / 2025

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of the Laboratory of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (Lab AI & DS) course. The course's primary objective is to provide students with practical experience in software development methodologies, artificial intelligence (AI), data science (DS), teamwork, and communication. Students are encouraged to apply their knowledge from prior coursework, along with research methodologies, to solve a specific problem.

In the second project, the focus was on implementing a comprehensive approach to **stock forecasting and portfolio optimization using machine learning techniques and modern portfolio theory**. Our solution combines predictive modeling of S&P 500 stock prices with optimization strategies to build efficient investment portfolios.

## Notebooks
- NotebookFinal.ipynb: The final Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of the assignment, including all code, analysis, and results. This notebook also includes the scripts necessary to generate all CSV files used in the process.
- NotebookFinal.html: A HTML version of the notebook for convenient viewing without requiring a Jupyter environment.

Note: We decided not to include the datasets generated during this process, as some of them exceed 500MB. However, the provided notebook can be used to recreate all necessary datasets.
